/*
 * Note: Vector notation is used here but the actual function only deals with scalars.
 *
 * System:
 * 			x[n+1]  = A[n]*x[n] + B[n]*u[n]											(eq. 1)
 * 			y[n] 	= H[n]*x[n] + w[n]												(eq. 2)
 *
 * Measurement update:
 * 			K[n] 	 = MSE_pred[n]*H[n]^T*(H[n]*MSE_pred[n]*H[n] + C_w[n])^-1		(eq. 3)
 * 			x_est[n] = x_pred[n] + K[n]*(y[n] - H[n]*x_pred[n])						(eq. 4)
 * 			MSE_est[n] 	 = (I - K[n]*H[n])*MSE_pred[n]								(eq. 5)
 *
 * Time update:
 * 			x_pred[n] 	= A[n]*x_est[n]												(eq. 8)
 * 			MSE_pred[n] = A[n]*MSE_est[n]*A[n]^T + B[n]*C_u[n]*B[n]^T				(eq. 7)
 *
 * Notation:
 * 			A[n]			This matrix regards to how the state of x[n] updates.
 * 			x[n]			The actual signal value at time n if it could be measured.
 * 			x_est[n]		The estimated signal value at time n.
 * 			x_pred[n]		The predicted signal value at time n using the signal value at time n-1.
 * 							After time update this corresponds to value at time n+1 using signal value at time n
 * 			MSE_est[n]		E[(x[n] - x_est[n])*(x[n] - x_est[n])^T]
 * 			MSE_pred[n]		E[(x[n] - x_pred[n])*(x[n] - x_pred[n])^T]
 * 			u[n]			Noise (Assumed zero-mean) (Can we really assume this with our offset? Think so!)
 * 			B[n]			This matrix regards to how the noise u[n] updates.
 * 			y[n]			The measurement signal (E.i. the signal we measure).
 * 			H[n]			This matrix relates the measured signal y[n] with the actual signal x[n]
 * 			w[n]			Noise (Assumed zero-mean) (Can we really assume this with our offset? Think so!)
 * 			I				Unit-matrix
 * 			K[n]			The Kalman-gain
 * 			C_w[n]			The covariance matrix of w[n]
 * 			C_u[n]			The covariance matrix of u[n]
 * 			^T				The transform of a matrix
 *
 * 	Input:
 *			A Struct called Data containing the relevant data
 *
 * 	Output:
 * 			None

	// The problem with the code is the math below.
	// I need to find a way of manipulating the data the right way.
	// Maybe some variables shoud be considered doubles or something similiar.
	// Should use float (32bit) and not double (64 bit).

	// Measurement update:
	//K = (float)((Data->MSE_pred) * (Data->H) * ((float)1.0)/( (float)((Data->H) * (Data->MSE_pred) * (Data->H) + (Data->C_w)) ));
	//K = (float)( (Data->H) * (Data->MSE_pred)/( ((Data->H) * (Data->MSE_pred) * (Data->H) + (Data->C_w)) ));

	Data->x_pred 	= (Data->A) * (Data->x_est);
	Data->MSE_pred = (Data->A) * MSE_est * (Data->A) + (Data->B) * (Data->C_u) * (Data->B);

	//Data->x_est = y;

	// Debug:
	// Data->x_est = y;

	// Comment:
	// Can I declare some variable as uint8_t instead of uint16_t?
	// Or will that mess up my math?

	// Question:
	// How large in uint16_t is really the signals we are dealing with?
